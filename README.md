# Mega Tetris For Sega Genesis

**Current Code Version:** 0.8.2

**Depencency:** [SGDK 1.5.1](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK)

## Description and usage
This is my first project written for **SEGA Genesis** using [SGDK 1.5.1](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK) and **C**. The purpose of this source code is to create a complete example game to understand how SGDK and the SEGA Genesis Works. **The game is complete**. **Why Tetris?** Because Tetris is a game with a bit of everything and allow me to cover a lot of challenge that you find when you develop a game. Background management, Objects Creation, Musics, Sound Effects, Game States etc etc. have been addressed during the development of this example. 

**Attention:** I will improve the source code and the game as soon as I can, adding more feartures and examples. Maybe you can find some bugs or some codes smell (**I'm not a C programmer** :P ), so please tell me if you find something strange or if you just want to do some code review. My intention was to write an understandable and clean code, so anyone can navigate and understand it without problems.

The gfx is taken and modified from the game "**Puyo Puyo TSU**", the music is taken from "**Aero the Acro-Bat**". I'm not an artist and I can't make music. Sorry.
